# ATM_controller:
Implemented a simple ATM controller

This repository is for a simple ATM. It doesn't have any UI (either graphical or console), but a controller is implemented and tested.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. enter in terminal - `cd ATM_controller`
3. Run it: `python3 ATM.py`

## Testing:
* For testing please use -  
    * card number as 12345 or 22222. (these are saved by default for testing but these can be changed in the code)
    * Enter pin as 1234 for 12345 and 2345 for 22222.
    * The balance is 100 by default. (there is an option to change that as well)
    
 ## Operations in the code:
 1.) Withdraw 
 2.) Deposit 
 3.) Check balance 
 4.) Create random transaction receipt 
 
 ## Comments - 
 * Dummyback_API is to check pin number and check if the account is valid which are saved in the dictionary.
 * It has a predefined default dictionary which is made for testing pupose but enter_values can be used to enter values in the database.
